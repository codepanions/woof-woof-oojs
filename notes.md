# Notes

- `index.js` is no longer attached to the app, it's just a reference for Vanilla JS functionality
- This app uses a `static` method to get each `dog` instead of a `fetch` request
- `static` methods are useful ways to create utility methods for your data
  - A utility method does some sort of labor/logic for you by encapsulating a function that is used often throughout the code
